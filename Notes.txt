In summary, MongoDB Compass is a tool to visualize and interact with data stored in a MongoDB database,
and MongoDB Atlas is a cloud-based service that hosts and manages MongoDB databases,
including the actual storage of data.

1->(done) how does select work with populate and what does it return and how to select some fields 
  const retweets = await Retweet.find({user: req.params.userId}).select("tweet, -_id").populate({
    path: "tweet",
    select: ""
  }) 
  
here we find all object and select tweet from it and to select fields from populated we use .populate({path: "tweet",select: ""}) 


// upload photo 
to upload photo with tweet or comment we use multer middleWare before createTweet, 
check in createTweet if there is file create tweet with photo path else create simple tweet 

In terms of performance, the aggregation pipeline approach might be more efficient for larger datasets because 
it minimizes the data transferred between the database and the application. 
Additionally, if you have indexes on the relevant fields (name, _id, follower, followed), the performance can be further optimized.


To search in someOne followers -> use aggregate: (there is voice in whatsapp) 
1) find all users with this name , 
2) lookup all follows which follower has this name, 
3) git all follows which follower has the name and followed the user id
